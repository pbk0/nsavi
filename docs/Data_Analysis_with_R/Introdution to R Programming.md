## Introduction to R Programming

It was developed by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka in the late 1990s.
They based R on the language S that came out of Bell Labs in the 1980s.
where John Tukey was encouraging people like John Chambers, Rick Beckers and
Allan Wilks to make better exploratory graphs of their data.<br />

The software is inspired by a desire to make it easy for any one to interact
with their data through simple commands. It is what we call it an interpreter language.
i.e., we write a command and the machine immediately answers that one command.
